# Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Santiago, I am an Optician-Optometrist, and now I am studying a Data Science bootcamp at The Bridge school. Gradually, I will be updating my work from both The Bridge and my personal projects.
* My first repository on data analysis, in this case focusing on myopia, optical defects, and solutions to these problems. [Link to repository.](https://github.com/Kuja182/Relevancia-de-los-defectos-opticos-en-la-actualidad)
